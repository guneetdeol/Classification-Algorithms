# Classification-Algorithms
In this project,  we will build a model to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. Different classification algorithms( k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression) are applied on the data and accuracy of each classifier is reported using the following metrics: Jaccard index, F1-score and Log Loss
